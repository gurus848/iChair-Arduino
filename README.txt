iChair - Arduino module

This code is meant to run on an Arduino Uno. It reads the analog input from multiple pressures which would be placed on a rolling computer chair, and uses the values to determine whether the user has correct posture or not. This is sent to the computer via Bluetooth, by writing to the Arduino serial port, which is connected to a bluetooth module.
